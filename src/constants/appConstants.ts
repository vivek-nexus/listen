You can also use it to proof-read your articles, explore pronunciation or even just to have fun! On desktop devices, try to use natural Google voices available in the Chrome browser. On Android/iOS, good voices are installed by default, but may need tweaking in device settings. If you like Listen, you can also install it as an app on your phone or desktop. Ok bye now!`
