export const DEFAULT_PASTED_ARTICLE = `Hello! Listen is your world-class reading companion. You can use this tool to listen to news pages or blog pages, as if they were podcasts. You can use it to proof-read, or should we say, proof-listen to your writing! So many possibilities, isn't it?

On desktop devices, use Google Chrome browser for natural sounding voices. On Android and iOS, you may need to first download and install voice data, in your device settings.

If you like Listen, you can install it as an app on your phone or desktop. Even more, you can quickly integrate it on your blog or webpages, so that your readers can instantly listen to your pages.

Okay bye bye!`
